# Spectra - Shared/Types

This module defines shared type definitions and type-safe abstractions 
intended to be used across multiple packages in the Spectra project. 
It centralizes commonly used data types and polymorphic constructs 
to encourage code reuse, reduce duplication, and ensure consistency 
throughout the codebase.
